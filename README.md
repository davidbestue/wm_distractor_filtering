# Working memory & Distractor filtering  

### Psychophysics.  
In this folder I analyze the data coming from behaviour.  
Raw data stored in local and Dropbox (paths given).  
The files inside this folder are:
+ ***Create_data_psychophysics.ipynb***    
++ Creats the DataFrame from raw data  
+ ***Correction_data_psychophysics.ipynb***  
++ Adds the correction from the perceptual biases (not used later on when analyzed).  
+ ***Subject summary.ipynb***  
++ Analysis of the interference effects created by the distractors.
